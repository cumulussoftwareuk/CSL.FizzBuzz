# CSL.Factorial

CSL.FizzBuzz is a console application for playing FizzBuzz.

## Usage

The easiest way to run it is through an IDE such as Rider or Visual Studio. You will need the .NET 7 SDK installed.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
  - CSL.FizzBuzz.ConsoleApp: The console application including the game engine and user interface.
  - CSL.FizzBuzz.Tests: Unit tests for the game.

## Limitations

The requirements were to print the results for a fixed range of 1 to 100, therefore no user input is accommodated.
